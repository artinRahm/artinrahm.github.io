thanks to artin,xen,lecron,
From the Clover team, thank you, guys, for the help in making this website. We are really happy with what we do, we are just teens making a fun website 
to have fun in school, this was never made for breaking school rules. This is a project that we are making. We hope you guys are happy and enjoy the new update <3
# Clover Website Update

I recently updated my website **Clover** with a new navigation change.  
Previously, clicking the **Apps** icon opened the apps section inside the Clover site.  
Now, the **Apps** icon redirects you to my new website for a smoother and more organized experience.

## 🔧 What Changed
- Updated the Apps icon link
- Added redirect to my new website
- Cleaned up navigation so users can easily find all apps and tools

## 🚀 Why the Change?
I moved all apps to a dedicated website to keep Clover lightweight and easier to maintain, while giving the apps their own space to grow.

## 🌐 Try It Out
Visit Clover and click the **Apps** icon to see the new redirect in action!
