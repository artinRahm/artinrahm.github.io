⛏️ Theme Update Patch Notes
📦 What Happened?

Our build team just pushed a major theme overhaul update — consider it the big “resource pack refresh.”

🪓 Theme Reduction

We mined out the clutter and trimmed the theme list from 30 down to 14.
Only the cleanest, strongest, highest-quality builds remain.

🎨 Theme Reworks

Most of the remaining themes were rebuilt, remodeled, or entirely reforged.
Everything should now look cleaner, more consistent, and more polished — like upgrading from stone tools to diamond.




I recently updated my website **Clover** with a new navigation change.  
Previously, clicking the **Apps** icon opened the apps section inside the Clover site.  
Now, the **Apps** icon redirects you to my new website for a smoother and more organized experience.

## 🔧 What Changed
- Updated the Apps icon link
- Added redirect to my new website
- Cleaned up navigation so users can easily find all apps and tools

## 🚀 Why the Change?
I moved all apps to a dedicated website to keep Clover lightweight and easier to maintain, while giving the apps their own space to grow.

## 🌐 Try It Out
Visit Clover and click the **Apps** icon to see the new redirect in action!
